Genisis (Electronic Water Control System)
This is my 1st year group project for Cutting Edge.
we done a Electronic water meter that may alert, if your limit is go off. 
this project have an IOT device that will calculate water flow and send to real time based database(Firebase).
then you can see your usage and control the water meter via an Android App.
Genesis also have a tap that you can control in via Android App.
i used Nodemcu,servo motor,lcd display and water flow sensor to create IOT device.
